Using Random Forest classifier I got 55% accuracy. (Commented out)

Using combination of Naive Bayes and SGD classifier I got 95% accuracy.

Just learned that Naive Bayes actually works well with discrete features (e.g., text classification)

Performed exhaustive gridsearch to find optimal parameters.
